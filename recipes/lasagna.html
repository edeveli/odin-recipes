<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lasagna is a wide, flat sheet of pasta. Lasagna can refer to either the type of noodle or to the typical lasagna dish which is a dish made with several layers of lasagna sheets with sauce and other ingredients, such as meats and cheese, in between the lasagna noodles.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p><ul><li>1 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li> 
    <li> pound ground beef chuck</li>
    <li> 1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
    <li> 1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce</li>
    <li> 3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)</li>
    <li> 1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
    <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (preferably flat leaf), packed</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>1 pinch garlic powder and/or garlic salt</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon to 1/4 cup sugar (to taste, optional)</li>
    <li>Salt</li></ul></p>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Put pasta water on to boil</li> 
        <li>Put a large pot of salted water (1 Tbsp salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat. It can take a while for a large pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your pasta water), so prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating.</li> 
        <li>Brown the ground beef</li>
        <li>In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium high heat. Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides.</li> 
        <li>Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Drain off all but a tablespoon of fat.</li></ol></p>
